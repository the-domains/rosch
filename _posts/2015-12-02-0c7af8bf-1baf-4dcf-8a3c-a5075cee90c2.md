I am a clinician/scientist, interested in the dynamics of **large-scale neuronal networks during human development**. Currently I am working with[Karl Friston][0]and[Torsten Baldeweg][1]on experimentally deriving an effective connectivity account of developmental changes of sensory processing using**dynamic causal modeling**on EEG. I am combining this work with investigations into specific epilepsy patient cohorts and**computational models**, probing the links between neuronal pathophysiology and network-wide abnormalities.

During my clinical training I have worked with[Deb Pal][2]on identifying genetic contributions to common childhood epilepsy syndromes and setting up a clinical epilepsy genetics service in South London. I have also been investigating asymmetric brain networks with[Dorothy Bishop][3], and[Jennifer Gurd][4]with whom I continue to collaborate.

Clinically I am interested in**paediatric epilepsy**as well as the global impact of neurological conditions. I am an active member of the [King's-THET-Somaliland-Partnership][5], where I help coordinate online teaching, go on in-country clinical teaching trips and have just started a research support group to aid development of research infrastructure in Somaliland and support increased research activity there.
